# project-face-generation
## Project Overview
In this project, I Builded a pair of multi-layer neural networks and make them compete against each other in order to generate new, realistic faces, training them on a set of celebrity faces. After training generator network generator will generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible. The image below is the result of the training.
